One method for enhancing simulation continuity of Snesim algorithm using multiple search trees

1.The 'mGstat' library, created by Thomas Mejer Hansen, serves as a fundamental tool for this study and is utilized extensively throughout the tests. It plays a crucial role in the analysis, modeling, and simulation of geostatistical data. (https://github.com/cultpenguin/mGstat).

2.The 'Paper_Test_Code' includes all the data and code used in this paper. Figure 9-22 can be displayed by simply running the program.

3.The 'relycode' includes important functions necessary for running the 'Paper_Test_Code' program.

4.The 'export_fig-master' package is utilized to export figures. (https://github.com/altmany/export_fig)

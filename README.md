# MPS_Snesim
One method for improving simulation continuity of Snesim algorithm using multiple search trees

1.The basic library 'mGstat' is developed by Thomas Mejer Hansen (https://github.com/cultpenguin/mGstat). Thanks a lot for Prof. Hansen making the multi-point geostatistics package open source.

2.The 'Paper_Test_Code' contains all the data and codes for the paper. Figure 9-19 could be shown just by clicking to run the program.

3.The 'relycode' contains some key functions for 'Paper_Test_Code' running.

4.The 'export_fig-master' is used for figure exporting. (https://github.com/altmany/export_fig)

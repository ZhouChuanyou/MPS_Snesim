# MPS_Snesim
One method for improving simulation continuity of Snesim algorithm using multiple search trees

1.The basic library 'mGstat' is developed by Thomas Mejer Hansen (https://github.com/cultpenguin/mGstat). Thanks a lot for sharing the great Lib.

2.The 'Paper_Test_Code' contains all the data and codes for the paper. 
My computer has double screens, so some figures may display on the other screen. 
If you use computer with single screen, you could reset the position of  gcf in the code for the figure out.

3.The 'relycode' contains some key functions for the 'Paper_Test_Code'.

4.'export_fig-master' is used for figure exporting. (https://github.com/altmany/export_fig)
